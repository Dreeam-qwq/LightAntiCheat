# Contributing to LightAntiCheat

LightAntiCheat is happy that you want to contribute to the project! We are always looking for new contributors to help us improve the project. We have a few guidelines that we ask you to follow when contributing to the project.



## Requirements
To get started PRing changes you will need to have the following installed/condition met:
- Java 8 JDK or later (21 is recommented because your changes have to work on EVERY version)
- Git (obviously)
- Hardware capable of running a Minecraft server with Paper, Spigot, Folia on different versions

## Changes you are not allowed to make
- Changes you can't "defend" like when your professor asks you what something does you should be able to explain it (We won't ask you lol)
- Changes that are not related to the project such as adding web interfaces, anti-xray, etc.
- Changes to code that works without any issues and doesn't need to be changed (never change a running system)

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes on every version of Minecraft that we support (Or cover most of them such as 1.8, 1.9, 1.12, 1.21)
5. Push your changes to your fork
6. Create a pull request
7. Relax ðŸ˜Ž

## Tips

- You can set your output folder for the jars in the **gradle.properties** file.

**Real men don't test in production. Test your changes before you PR them. If you don't test them we will test them and if they don't work we will close your PR.**
